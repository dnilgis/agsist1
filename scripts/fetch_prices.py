fetch_prices.py — fetches commodity/futures/index/crypto prices via yfinance
Writes to data/prices.json. Run by GitHub Actions every 30min on weekdays.
All free, no API key needed.

v3.1 — 2026-04-26 (afternoon)
  yfinance fast_info can return float('nan') for missing fields
  (e.g. previous_close on a thin-volume crypto). The old `... or ...`
  fallback and `if prev else close` checks both treat NaN as truthy,
  so NaN flowed through net/pctChange and into prices.json. Browsers
  refuse to parse JSON with bare NaN literals — every price card on
  the homepage went blank. Now sanitized via _num() and json.dump is
  invoked with allow_nan=False as a fail-fast backstop.

v3 — 2026-04-26
  Added 19 grain forward-curve contracts (corn, beans, wheat) with year-explicit
  keys. Wheat now has 6 deferred contracts (previously had none — forward curve
  was rendering with one data point). All keys use an explicit year suffix so
  there is no ambiguity about which contract the data refers to.

  ANNUAL CONTRACT MAINTENANCE — please read.
  ------------------------------------------
  CBOT grain contracts roll throughout the year as nearby months expire.
  Roughly:
    - Mar contracts (H) expire mid-March
    - May contracts (K) expire mid-May
    - Jul contracts (N) expire mid-July
    - Sep contracts (U) expire mid-September
    - Dec contracts (Z) expire mid-December
    - Beans add Jan (F), Aug (Q), Nov (X)

  When a contract expires, yfinance starts returning empty data and the
  "preserve last known value" logic in this script will keep the stale
  number until you replace the ticker.

  RECOMMENDED ROUTINE: Once a year (early Jan is convenient), audit the
  SYMBOLS dict below. For each grain ticker, advance the year suffix on
  any contract whose calendar month is now in the past. Pattern:

      "corn-jul26": "ZCN26.CBT",     becomes
      "corn-jul28": "ZCN28.CBT",     after July 2026 expires

  Also update the two new-crop benchmark aliases each fall:
      "corn-dec":  "ZCZ26.CBT"  →  ZCZ27.CBT  (around Nov-Dec each year)
      "beans-nov": "ZSX26.CBT"  →  ZSX27.CBT  (around Oct-Nov each year)

  These aliases are used by the corn-bean ratio business logic on the
  futures pages and must point to the current new-crop benchmark.

v2 — 2026-03-24
  Added wk52_hi / wk52_lo from fast_info.year_high / year_low.
