AGSIST fetch_markets.py  v5
════════════════════════════
Fetches prediction-market odds relevant to agriculture from Kalshi
and Polymarket.  Runs once daily via GitHub Actions (6 AM CT).

v5 changes (2026-03-03):
  • FIX: Kalshi ticker hashes (e.g. "S2026FDA8DCAB06F") were included in
    scoring text — "FDA" substring matched TIER2, giving NBA parlays score 70.
    Now scoring uses only human-readable text (title + subtitle).
  • FIX: Added parlay/multi-leg detection to is_meme_market() — catches
    "yes NAME: N+" patterns from Kalshi cross-category bets.
  • FIX: Added KXMVE/CROSSCATEGORY ticker prefix detection for Kalshi
    multi-event sports markets.
  • Expanded SPORTS_PLAYER_PATTERNS with more active players.

v4 changes (2026-03-02):
  • Lowered minimum relevance to 40 (was 60)
  • Massively expanded meme/junk filter
  • Graceful empty-state: output always valid even with 0 markets

Sources (public, no API keys required):
  • Kalshi      — https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets
  • Polymarket  — https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets
