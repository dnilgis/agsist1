Corn added a nickel to finish at $4.48\u00bd, while beans tacked on a nickel to $11.70\u00be. But livestock took it on the chin \u2014 live cattle dropped $4.75 to $232.22 and feeders fell $7.60 to $351.20 as direct cash trade disappointed and the broader market wobbled. The big story for this week is weather: Central Illinois is staring down 1.6 inches of rain over the next five days, with the heaviest stuff hitting Tuesday through Thursday. That'll keep fieldwork on hold and give anyone thinking about early burndown applications something to think about.",

If you were planning burndown applications or fertilizer spreading in central Illinois, you're looking at delays until at least the weekend. Iowa stays drier with just 0.34 inches, so the window stays better out west."

      "body": "Corn front month settled Friday at $4.48\u00bd, up a nickel, while December '26 added two cents to $4.69\u00bd \u2014 that 21-cent carry (the premium for storing corn until December) barely covers commercial storage and interest, telling you the market isn't rewarding anyone for holding on-farm right now. Soybeans closed at $11.70\u00be, up a nickel on technical buying and short covering, though meal slipped $1.60 to $320.50 per ton and oil was dead flat at 61.85 cents per pound. The soybean crush margin (what a processor makes turning beans into meal and oil) remains tight, which isn't helping demand for farmer beans. Chicago wheat was the star, jumping nearly 15 cents to $5.91\u00bd on a weaker dollar and lingering questions about Plains wheat condition after the winter's wild weather swings. The wheat rally caught some attention, but it's still a long way from pulling acres away from corn and beans this spring."

      "body": "Cattle markets got hammered Friday as direct cash trade came in softer than expected and equity markets sold off. Live cattle fell $4.75 to $232.22 while feeders dropped $7.60 to $351.20, wiping out some of the recent rally. Hogs held steady at $95.62, barely moving, but Class III milk futures took a 6% hit, falling $1.06 to $16.28, which will sting dairy producers already dealing with tight margins. With corn at $4.48\u00bd and soybean meal at $320.50, feed costs remain manageable, but the livestock price pullback means anyone running cattle needs to watch breakevens closely. If you're thinking about forward-contracting cattle or buying feeders, this dip might create an opportunity \u2014 but only if you believe the broader demand story holds up."

      "body": "The Corn Belt splits into two worlds this week. Central Illinois catches the worst of it with 1.64 inches of rain spread across Tuesday through Thursday, with temperatures climbing into the 50s and even touching 72\u00b0F by Friday. That's fieldwork-killing moisture that'll keep equipment parked until the weekend at earliest. Central Iowa stays drier with just 0.34 inches total, mostly coming Friday, giving producers there a better window for early season work if soil temps cooperate. Wisconsin and South Dakota stay mostly dry until week's end, with South Dakota even flirting with 70\u00b0 by midweek before rain moves in Friday. Southeast Nebraska gets moderate moisture (0.39 inches) late week. Bottom line: If you're in Illinois or planning burndown applications, write off Tuesday through Thursday. Iowa and points west, you've got a narrow window early week if you need to move. This warming trend (multiple days in the 50s and 60s) will start pulling frost out of the ground where it's shallow, but don't get too excited \u2014 it's still early March."

      "title": "Energy, Dollar & Outside Markets",
      "body": "Crude oil climbed $1.71 to $67.02 per barrel, which translates to higher diesel costs for spring fieldwork and keeps pressure on anhydrous ammonia prices since natural gas (the feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer) also ticked up to $2.86. The dollar index barely moved at 97.61, staying neutral, which is good news for export competitiveness \u2014 a flat dollar doesn't make US grain any more or less attractive to foreign buyers right now. The S&P 500 slipped 30 points and the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 3.96%, suggesting some economic nervousness, but for agriculture the bigger story is energy: every dollar crude rallies adds about 2-3 cents per gallon to your diesel bill, and you'll be burning plenty of it once planting starts."

Separately, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins outlined five priorities at Commodity Classic and announced the department is selling its massive South Building in Washington as part of cost-cutting efforts. On the sobering side, Farm Bureau data shows farm bankruptcies jumped 46% in 2025, hitting 315 Chapter 12 filings compared to 216 the prior year \u2014 a clear signal financial stress is building across rural America, especially for operations carrying heavy debt loads into a lower commodity price environment. That bankruptcy number is a wake-up call for lenders and producers alike to stress-test cashflow assumptions for 2026."

    "title": "Why March Weather Lies to Farmers",
    "body": "March in the Corn Belt is famous for teasing farmers with warm spells that make you think about planting, then slapping you back to reality with a late freeze. Soil temperature matters more than air temperature \u2014 corn needs sustained 50\u00b0F soil temps at 2-inch depth to germinate reliably. A 70\u00b0F day in early March warms the air but doesn't mean the ground is ready. Old-timers say wait until the oak leaves are the size of a squirrel's ear, which typically coincides with stable soil temps. Planting into cold, wet soil invites poor stands, seedling diseases, and uneven emergence that costs yield all season long. Patience in March pays dividends in November."
