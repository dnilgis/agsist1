  "lead": "Chicago wheat futures closed Friday up 14.75 cents to $5.91\u00bd, the strongest single-day gain in weeks, while live cattle dropped $4.75 to $232.23 as the livestock complex took a beating. Corn added 4.75 cents to $4.48\u00bd on short covering, and soybeans tacked on 5.25 cents to $11.70\u00be. The moves set up an interesting week: grain producers face a split weather pattern with dry conditions across the western Corn Belt but 1-1.5 inches of rain coming to Illinois and parts of Indiana by midweek. For livestock producers, the sharp drop in cattle futures\u2014down 2% in one session\u2014reflects softer cash trade and profit-taking after a strong run, but margins remain historically solid for those with cattle on feed.",

    "context": "That 2.6% jump in Chicago wheat suggests short covering and weather concerns in global wheat areas. If you're sitting on old-crop wheat in the bin, this rally might be your best selling window before harvest pressure returns. Watch basis levels at your local elevator this week\u2014if they're firm, don't wait."

Soybeans gained 5\u00bc cents to $11.70\u00be, but November '26 was flat at $11.28\u00bc, showing a 42-cent inverse that rewards forward selling new crop if you're confident in your yield. Wheat stole the show with a 14\u00be-cent jump to $5.91\u00bd on technical buying and short covering. The corn-bean price ratio sits at 2.61 bushels of corn to buy one bushel of beans\u2014near the five-year average, so no huge planting signal either way yet. Oats were quiet, down a quarter-cent."

Lean hogs were steady at 95.6 cents. Class III milk took a brutal 6% hit, down $1.06 to $16.28, squeezing dairy margins. Soybean meal eased $1.60 to $320.50, but with corn and meal both relatively soft, feed costs remain manageable for cattle feeders\u2014though that cattle price drop means the margin cushion just got thinner. If you're marketing fat cattle this week, don't panic-sell into the weekend weakness; cash trade could stabilize early in the week."

      "body": "The Corn Belt is splitting this week. Central Illinois is tracking 1.49 inches of rain over the next five days, with the heaviest Wednesday-Thursday (1.37 inches combined), which will saturate soils and delay any early fieldwork. Iowa and Nebraska stay drier\u2014just 0.10-0.22 inches\u2014so northern and western areas could see some equipment moving if temps cooperate. South Dakota is warming nicely, hitting 70\u00b0 by Friday with zero precip, which is good news for early spring prep. Wisconsin stays cold and quiet. If you're planning burndown applications or early nitrogen, the window in Iowa/Nebraska is Monday-Tuesday before moisture chances rise midweek. Illinois and Indiana producers should plan shop work and maintenance through Thursday; those fields will be too wet to roll."

      "body": "Crude oil jumped $1.71 to $67.02, and natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.86\u2014both supportive for corn via ethanol and fertilizer demand, though higher energy costs add to input expenses for spring. The dollar index was flat at 97.62, which keeps US grain export-competitive. The S&P 500 dipped 0.4%, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.96%, signaling some investor caution but nothing alarming. Gold and silver rallied sharply (gold up $47, silver up $3.16), often a sign of safe-haven buying, but agricultural fundamentals remain more important than outside market jitters right now."

The Cold Storage Annual Summary hit the wire, though details weren't market-moving. More significant: Farm Bureau data shows Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies jumped 46% in 2025 to 315 filings, up from 216 in 2024, a stark reminder of margin stress across the sector. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans to sell the department's flagship South Building in Washington as part of cost-cutting, though that's symbolic more than operational. Dicamba is back for 2026 with tighter compliance\u2014if you plan to use over-the-top applications, get trained early and communicate with neighbors now to avoid drift issues."

    "title": "Why Wheat Pops on Fridays",
    "body": "Wheat futures often see exaggerated moves on Friday afternoons due to 'weekend risk' and short covering. Speculators don't want to hold short positions over the weekend when global weather or geopolitical news could break, so they buy back contracts to flatten exposure. That's part of why Friday's 14\u00be-cent wheat rally was so sharp\u2014funds were caught leaning short and scrambled to cover. It's a pattern worth watching if you're timing grain sales."
