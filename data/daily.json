Three-day precipitation totals just 0.32 inches \u2014 ground conditions remain firm. Early March looks manageable for fieldwork prep, but overnight lows in the low 20s mean no rush on soil temps. Wind at 16 mph could accelerate topsoil drying where frost is coming out."

Crude oil rallied 2.62% to 67.02, which lifts input costs and supports ethanol margins. The dollar index slipped slightly to 97.565 and the 10-year fell to 3.962%, keeping borrowing costs manageable for now. S&P 500 off 0.43% \u2014 risk-off mood but nothing dramatic."
